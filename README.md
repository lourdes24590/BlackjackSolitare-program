# BlackjackSolitare-program
This is project done for a school assignment (CIT 591 University of Pennsylvania) 
The goal is to create a very basic Blackjack Solitare game with no graphics. 
This game is based on:
https://www.solitairenetwork.com/solitaire/blackjack-square-solitaire-game.html
The only thing as a player you will need to do is just run the BlackjackSolitareRunner.java class under src file.
Let the game begin from there.
